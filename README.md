More or less simple setup to reproduce Meson build-rpath difficulty.

This will install some files to `/tmp/special/dir`.

Steps:

1. `meson build`
2. `ninja -C build install`
3. Set `preparation` to `false` in main `meson.build` file.
4. Start from scratch: `rm -Rf build && meson --pkg-config-path=/tmp/special/dir/pkgconfig build`
5. `ninja -C build`
6. `ldd build/tests/mytest`
7. `readelf -d build/tests/mytest`

Step 2 sets an additional library (`libbar`) up in the special directory also used by `libfoo`.
Foo is the library we really want to build and test.
All libraries in that special dir have appropriate rpath settings in
their pkgconfig files.

Step 3 removes the preliminary steps in Meson to install `libbar`. The preparation is finished
and we have two libraries installed in the special directory. Now this setup will only work
on `foo` and use the previously installed `bar`.

Step 4 uses the previously installed pkgconfig files and libs in the special directory.

Step 5 builds a new `foo`, that we want to test. We do not know anything about `bar` anymore and
want to fetch it as dependency. When we run the test executable, instead of using
our new `foo` the old library from step 2 is found:

Step 6 + 7 output:
```
$ ldd build/tests/mytest
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffbe78e000)
        libfoo.so.0.8.15 => /tmp/special/dir/libfoo.so.0.8.15 (0x00007f7d1c312000)
        libbar.so.47.11 => /tmp/special/dir/libbar.so.47.11 (0x00007f7d1c30d000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f7d1c101000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f7d1c31e000)

$ readelf -d build/tests/mytest | grep path
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [/tmp/special/dir:$ORIGIN/../src]
```

This is because the pkgconfig options (i.e. `-Wl,rpath=`) are placed in front of the current building-rpath options generated by Meson,
and are thus evaluated too late.

`$ORIGIN/../src` should come first to make sure the current build artifact is found first.

So what we really want to have but do not get is this:
```
$ ldd build/tests/mytest
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffe0781000)
        libfoo.so.0.8.15 => /home/fini/git/foo/build/tests/../src/libfoo.so.0.8.15 (0x00007f730c687000)
        libbar.so.47.11 => /tmp/special/dir/libbar.so.47.11 (0x00007f730c682000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f730c476000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f730c693000)

$ readelf -d build/tests/mytest | grep path                                                                                                                                  master ✚ 2 
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [$ORIGIN/../src:/tmp/special/dir]
```
